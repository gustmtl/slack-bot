# ALTBTC performance & ranking - Slackbot

The main objective is to screen altcoins to be able to spot the best performing ones without needing to go through the whole list on coinmarketcap.

Currently, we compare the performance of the top 80 coins in market cap and get the top 25 gainers in btc terms. This list is sent through a dedicated slack-channel. We look at the price change over two different timeframes: 24 hours and 3 days. 

### 24 hours price changes
We compare the price changes over the past 24 hours, and display there 7 days performance as well. This gives a short term signal of which coins have been performing well. 

### 3 days price changes
We compare the price changes of altcoins over the past 3 days (first 12h of the period against last 12h). Signals should be less noisy than for 24h changes, and could spot the beginning of strong & sustained uptrends.
